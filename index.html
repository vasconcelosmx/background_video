		<h2>Just a song of my 2003</h2>
		Just a song of my 2003<br>
		Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember I'll always remember the sound of the stereo<br>
		The dim of the soft lights<br>
		The scent of your hair<br>
		That you twirled in your fingers<br>
		And the time on the clock<br>
		When we realized it's so late<br>
		And this walk that we shared together<br>
		And the streets were wet<br>
		And the gate was locked<br>
		So I jumped it<br>
		And I let you in<br>
		And you stood at your door<br>
		With your hands on my waist<br>
		And you kissed me<br>
		Like you meant it<br>
		And I knew<br>
		That you meant it<br>
		That you meant it<br>
		That you meant it<br>
		And I knew<br>
		That you meant it<br>
		That you meant it<br>
